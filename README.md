A simple one-click application for removing cellphone numbers from test users. I saw a need for this tool as my team had to use our live personal numbers for test users but we had to remove them before we could reuse our numbers. This task would delay whatever we were doing by 10-15 minutes. So I developed a tool where we could simply select which environment the user was in and nuke the number.
